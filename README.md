Welcome to my REACT.js News article app! It was created across 4 days for the back end (Express.js with PostgreSQL) and 4 days for the front end (REACT.js).

Link to the deployed app: https://quizzical-clarke-4e8b78.netlify.app/

This is a react.js app that displays various articles and their respective comment section around multiple topics. It uses a backend that I created which is hosted on heroku. You can use the app by either clicking on which topic you want to see articles for, click on various articles to read them and see their comments, add comments, upvote on articles you like, delete comments made by the pseudo logged in user etc. You can also search for different areas in the app via the url.

Node version ^v14.15.4 is required.

Cloning Repo : In command line of where you would like the repo to sit in your file structure - $git clone https://github.com/BillyZen/nc-news-deploy.git
